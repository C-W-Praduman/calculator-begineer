# This is my first try to push code  on github 
# Simple Calculator

This is my first project on GitHubâ€”a basic calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides essential arithmetic operations with a simple and minimal UI.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
- Simple and easy-to-use interface.

## Future Enhancements
As I continue learning, I plan to add more features, including:
- **Improved UI/UX**: Adding better styling and animations.
- **Keyboard support**: Allowing users to use their keyboard for input.
- **History feature**: Displaying previous calculations.
- **Dark mode**: A toggle switch for dark/light themes.
- **Scientific functions**: Additional operations like square root, power, and trigonometric functions.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Contributions
Since this is my learning project, I welcome suggestions and improvements. Feel free to open issues or pull requests!
